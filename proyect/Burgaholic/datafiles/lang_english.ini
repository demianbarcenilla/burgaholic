2="You know, that guy there told me that ''It hurts to breathe''. He's a MUSHROOM. He doesn't NEED to breathe"
3="You know where it's difficult to breathe?"
4="The Core! The center of our world."

[ShopDakota_W7finished]
0="I'm getting so tired of this. This one's REALLY suspicious but i couldn't find anything"
1="I'm guessing it's some kind of mascot?"
2="I don´t care anymore, let´s talk about The Pond!"

[ShopDakota_W8finished]
0="You have NO idea how happy it makes me to know who had my recipes, and that he's currently swimming in a pool of toxic waste"
1="But i'm done. The biker won't let me anywhere near my recipes. He even wants me to pay him. For MY OWN things!"
2="I just wanted to screw the guy who stole from me though, so it's okay"
3="If you're willing to pay the dirtbag for the other half of my recipes, you can keep 'em"

2="But also a cool trophy to have, really an item only a true completionist would get!"
3="Remember when i met you? I asked you to help me out because you probably had nothing else to do and i really wanted to mess up a guy..."
4="Well this lollypop was all you! No one asked you for it, no one truly needs it"

6="Buckle Up!"

[ChatBurgPixie_Jump]
0="WOAH! ¡THAT WAS AMAZING! You are truly a master of walking!"
1="But can you master the powerful JUMP!?"

[ChatBurgPixie_Bounce]
0="You learn so fast! Those were definitely jumps."
1="I don't think that's gonna be enough, though"
2="Imagine this: You press the jump button once, right?"
3="Then you press it again! What would happen then?"
4="...That's RIGHT! You drop to the floor immediately!"
5="So now you know, press JUMP, then JUMP again in the air!"

[ChatBurgPixie_Roll]
0="Woah, you're practically a spring!"
1="Keep bouncing like that and you'll reach the highest of platforms."
2="But WAIT! What if you wanted to reach the FURTHEST of platforms instead?"
3="Ah! We have a different option for that"
4="Picture this: You're on the ground, looking downwards, and you try to jump"
5="But instead you mess up and start rolling at high speeds!"
6="Yup that's what you're doing next."
7="Remember: Press DOWN + JUMP! THEN jump again to clear that gap!"

[ChatBurgPixie_Dash]
0="You rolled wonderfully! I'm such a great teacher"
1="Here's a fun little fact: If you roll from a cliff and you haven't jumped yet. you still can!"
2="This will earn you some extra distance. It's very useful, i promise!"
3="Now, let's talk about the dash!"
4="See those two columns? your roll can't reach that far, and your bounce is useless"
5="So do it! Press the DASH button in the air to DASH!"
6="I know, you couldn't have guessed that without me"

[ChatBurgPixie_Enemies]
0="Annnnd that's it! That was the dash."
1="You can only dash in the air, but it gives you just a liiitle more distance"
2="It's very short BUT! You can pair it up with rolls and bounces."
3="In fact, you can string all of these moves together in almost any order you want. You should try it later!"
4="Oh, and one last thing"
5="See that floating being? That's an enemy! If you touch them normally they'll hurt you BUT"
6="If you hit them with any of these moves instead, you'll be the one doing all the damaging heehee"
7="You can use the enemies to boost yourself higher, so do it, smash their skulls!"

[ChatBurgPixie_Finish]
0="That's it! get creative with these little tips and you'll make good progress!"
