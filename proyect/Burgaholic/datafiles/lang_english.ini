0="You learn so fast! Those were definitely jumps."
1="I don't think that's gonna be enough, though"
2="Imagine this: You press the jump button once, right?"
3="Then you press it again! What would happen then?"
4="...That's RIGHT! You drop to the floor immediately!"
5="...What do you mean that wasn't your guess?"

[ChatBurgPixie_Roll]
0="Woah, you're practically a slime! Or a spring or something."
1="Keep bouncing like that and you'll reach the highest of platforms."
2="But WAIT! What if you wanted to reach the FURTHEST of platforms instead?"
3="Ah! We have a different option for that"
4="Picture this: You're on the ground, looking downwards, and you try to jump"
5="But instead you mess up and start rolling at high speeds!"
6="Yup that's what you're doing next."

[ChatBurgPixie_Dash]
0="Those rolls were amazing!"
1="Here's a fun little fact: If you roll from a cliff and you haven't jumped yet. you can."
2="This will earn you some extra distance. It's very useful, i promise!"
3="What if you wanted even MORE distance than that?"
4="Well, that's where you dash."

[ChatBurgPixie_StringMoves]
1="Annnnd that's it! That was the dash. If only it wasn't so useless..."
2="You can only dash in the air, but it gives you just a liiitle more distance somehow"
3="It's very short BUT! You can pair it up with rolls and bounces."
4="In fact, you can string all of these moves together in any order you want. Try it!"

[ChatBurgPixie_Finish]
1="That's it! get creative with these and you'll make good progress!"
2="Towards what? I don't know, i'm just a dream."
