1="Me? I didn't mean to hurt you!"
2="This is going to sound dumb, but some guy put me in a machine and..."
3="I don't know! I blacked out after that"
4="Anyways, my name is Dakota. I collect Hatburgers! Or at least, used to"
5="There are 7 other people who are known to collect them. It's an interesting hobby, after all!"
6="And i'm guessing the guy who knocked me out was a collectionist too"
7="...Wait. You don't know what a hatburger is?"
8="Let's get out of here, i'll tell you on the way"

[PrevShopDakota]
0="...So yeah, that's what a hatburger is!"
1="They're completely useless, i know"
2="But hey, people are into them"
3="Anyways, can you do me a favour?"
4="I don't know how you turned me back to normal, but that's a thing you can do apparently"
5="So you could check on the others, maybe help them out if they're in trouble?"
6="I don't have enough burgers to be the sole target of this attack, i'm sure! So it probably happened to everyone else"
7="All i can remember is a smile... A very ugly one, but a smile!"
8="I happen to know one of the other collectionists, and i can assure you. He can't smile at all!"
9="He lives on The Volcano. I just need you to go there and find him"
10="You seem like you got some spare time, don't you?"
10="You'll get to explore, collect some burgers! Isn't that EXCITING!?"
11="When you're ready, go through that tube over there. It'll take you where you need to go"
12="...One last thing"

[ShopDakota]
0="...Do you want to buy my recipes? I sorta don't need this garbage anymore. Not if it's gonna get me killed!"
1="And you gotta start your collection somewhere!"

[ShopDakota_finished]
0="That's it! Nothing more to buy"
1="What are you still doing here?"

[ShopDakota_W1finished]
0="You bought every recipe!"
1="Let me give you some tips for your trips!"
2="As i said, you need to go to The Spicy Volcano to find my fellow collectionist friend"
3="The Volcano is filled with explosives and, for some reason, tiny volcanoes"
4="Checks out!"
5="That's all. That's the tip."

[ShopDakota_W2finished]
0="When i said he can't smile, i meant it"
1="He can't smile AT ALL! if he opens his mouth he will explode and die. Hahah!"
2="Anyways, since he was attacked too, the next step is rescuing everyone else"
3="...Your next stop is The Beach! Now THAT'S a calming place"
4="With its paper boats and crystal clear water... Did you know you can float in there?"
5="Unless a jellyfish grabs you"
6="Yeah i don't get it either"

[ShopDakota_W3finished]
0="I'm glad the camel lady is fine!"
1="But i´m a bit tired of hearing about high cuisine or whatever"
2="Oh yeah, your next stop... The fridge!"
3="I don't like it, personally. The cold, the saws, the walls covered in moss..."
4="At least you can jump off the moss! That's a fun activity"

[ShopDakota_W4finished]
0="Look, another conehead! Just like yourself."
1="Hope you enjoyed the heights and all but now it's time to go to one of the deepest places in the world. The Reef!"
2="With the HUGE naval mines and weird rock thingies. What a horrible place to visit"
3="Good thing i'm not going!"
4="Honestly the only way of going trough the reef is to swim, there's not much land to jump from"
5="The pressure is soooo high, you don't get to float like at The Beach!"
6="You don't know how to swim? Eh... I think you'll figure it out"

[ShopDakota_W5finished]
0="The fish lady TERRIFIES me! But she told me some things about Greg"
1="When you find him, please don't bring him here... He doesn't sound like a friend... Specially with the whole ''Trying to kill everyone'' situation!"
2="Which reminds me of The Ashtray! It used to be a cementery of sorts"
3="A long time ago it was full of... you know, corpses. But now it's just mushrooms all over the place"
4="Pretty trippy place, actually"

[ShopDakota_W6finished]
0="The new guy is such a baby... He's afraid of everything!"
1="EVERY. SINGLE. THING. And he won't shut up about it!"
2="You know, he even told told me that ''It hurts to breathe''. He's a MUSHROOM. He doesn't NEED to breathe"
3="You know where it's difficult to breathe?"
4="The Core! The center of our world."
5="That place has some WEIRD vibes"
6="I have no idea what's going on with The Core, but try not to lose your teeth!"
7="...I mean it."

[ShopDakota_W7finished]
0="Hahah the new thing you brought is so nice!"
1="I'm guessing it's some kind of mascot?"
2="Maybe not. It's not really important, let's talk about The Pond!"
3="The Pond..."
4="I've never been there, actually."
5="I've heard it's a sort of wasteland, a very unsafe place in general"
6="But that's where Greg lives so... Yeah. Good luck!"
7="If you're not back in 3 days we'll think you're dead and make a grave for you"
8="And if you come back... No grave! Just celebration!"

[ShopDakota_W8finished]
0="You have NO idea how happy it makes me to know Greg's currently swimming in a pool of toxic waste"
1="And i didn't even personally MEET him! That's how bad he is"
2="I'll keep an eye on the new guy though. Just so he doesn't steal anything!"
3="Even if there's nothing interesting here to steal"
4="By the way, if you're missing some burgers, you really should try to get them"
5="I chose this place to stay because apparently there's something secret here"
6="And i think those missing burgers are the key!"

[ShopDakota_W9finished]
0="You got an ugly lollypop? That's so cool!"
1="It's completely useless! At least for now"
2="But also a cool trophy to have, really an item only a true completionist would get!"
3="Remember when i met you? I asked you to help me out because you probably had nothing else to do and i really wanted to mess up a guy..."
4="Well this lollypop was all you! No one asked you for it, no one truly needs it"
5="And that's why this lollypop is a treasure. It's a proof that you, indeed, had nothing better to do. At all"

1="I am Camella, the princess of the sand!"
2="...What's that? You want to know what happened"
3="Look, a couple months ago my castle was attacked by a man with VERY impressive technology"
4="The castle broke down, so i came here to live for a while. It's relaxing and safe. Not a proper household for a princess like myself, but still"
5="Well, looks like the man found me"
6="..."
7="I'm tired. Carry me somewhere safe!"

1="You're alright, peasant!"

[ChatCrystal]
0="Huh? You want to know what happened?"
1="That guy... Greg. He's not chill AT ALL"
2="He's been thinkering for a while with some science stuff, and learnt to manipulate SOUL MAGNETS"
3="You know, the thing that reasembles you when you died?"
4="Yeah, he found a way to separate your body from your soul with those"
5="I don't know what his plan is, but he's a scary guy... And a bit of a jerk"
6="..."
7="This chat is nice and all, but... You know... I'm upside down"

[ChatMadame]
0="Well, that sucked"

[ShopMadame]
0="Greg is so annoying, i would beat him up myself if he didn't live on land"
1="I can't fight as well when i'm not underwater. Downsides of being a fish, i guess..."
2="We used to be good friends, actually. We were both interested in collecting those funny looking creatures, and he was so enthusiastic about it too..."
3="But then he started yapping about wanting to be the best collectionist in the world, and how he'd do anything to achieve it"
4="It was a long time ago, though. I think he knew he couldn't beat anyone one on one, so he started using cheap tricks"
5="Like attacking me from behind like a loser"
6="Long story short, he's an idiot and nobody likes him"
7="Wanna buy some recipes?"

[ShopMadame_Finished]
0="Thanks, those burgers are heavy when you're not underwater"

[ChatRichard]
0="AHH! WHY DID YOU DO THAT!?"

[ShopRichard]
0="GREG?? DON'T SAY HIS NAME!!"
1="He used to be weak, and brittle. Just like ME!!"
2="But then he went to live on the pond, studying some crazy ancient machinery"
3="And now he's trying to KILL ME!! AND ANYONE WHO HAS SOME RECIPES!!"
4="Please take these burgers, TAKE THEM!! They're a burden, and i don't want to pay the price anymore!"
5="You. Do it. Pay the price!!"

[ShopRichard_Finished]
0="Some people say carrying your recipes with you is the best way to know they're not being stolen!!"

6="You wanna check it out?"

[ChatGreg]
0="Who are you?"
1="...I can see some recipes in your pocket"
2="In fact, the recipes i was trying to destroy"
3="As you probably know, since you came to me, my goal is to be the BEST collector in the world"
4="But it was just too hard, and every other collector was getting ahead of me."
5="So i figured, what if i just killed them all?"
6="It's easier to be the best if you're the only one."
7="But i couldn't figure out how... If i killed them, they would just reappear somewhere safe"
8="So my best shot was to separate their soul from their body. You can't reassemble a body if the soul is a separate thing"
9="But my invention just corrupted their souls instead"
10="Luckily i figured out a better plan. You want to know what it is?"

4="...That's RIGHT! You drop to the floor immediately!"

3="Ah! We have a different option for that"
