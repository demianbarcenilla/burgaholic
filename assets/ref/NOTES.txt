Angry Triangle:
You shoot randomly generated objects that appear onScreen. some of those are the burgers u gotta unlock. shoot em all

Anchor Drop: 
there's a buncha things running and you gotta drop an anchor. if you crush a burger, you get it

POLLINATE:
Pollinate flowers lol

HB CLASSIC:
same as hatburgers classic (with different sprites and reworked rooms) but the 3 burgers you'd get from this are collectibles. You found 2 of these in the levels and 1 after finishing the game

Booze Driver:
you gotta get a bus from point A to point B. problem is the bus will NOT stop. 3 small levels. Finish them all and you get 3 burgers
